# F-E-R-M
Freesound Euclidean Rhythm Machine. Written in JS and hosted [here](https://f-e-r-m.glitch.me/) on glitch.com

This is an app in which you can search through sounds from Freesound given text input, duration, and similarity (*).

Then add the sounds you like to the rhythm sequencer, and when you have a few click play! You can edit the beat division of each sound, its level, and the total number of beats in the rhythm.

You can then record your output and download it as a webm, mp3, or wav!
